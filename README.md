# Image-Classification-and-Clustering-Character-Images

The project addressed a dual challenge involving both classification and clustering tasks. The dataset consisted of 28x28 grayscale character images, with the primary objective being the accurate classification of these images into their respective classes. To achieve this goal, a range of machine learning algorithms, including KNN, Logistic Regression, SVM, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Extremely Randomized Trees, were employed and optimized to maximize the f1-score. In addition to the classification task, the project included a clustering component focused on grouping the images based on their respective centuries. To determine the optimal number of clusters for this task, the K-Means Algorithm was implemented, and the selection of the ideal cluster count was guided by the Normalized Mutual Information criterion.
